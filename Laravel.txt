Go to GitHub and log in.

Click the + button in the top right → New repository.

Give it a name (e.g., my-laravel-app).

Keep it public or private (your choice).

Do NOT initialize with a README (we’ll push our existing project).

Click Create repository.

You’ll now see a page with Git commands — keep it open.

Go to Your Laravel App Folder
Open your terminal and navigate to your Laravel project:
cd /path/to/your-laravel-app

Initialize Git in the Laravel App
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit of Laravel app"

Link Your GitHub Repository
Copy the repository URL from GitHub (looks like https://github.com/username/my-laravel-app.git) and run:
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-laravel-app.git


Push Your Laravel App to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


Now your Laravel app is on GitHub.
You can clone it later on EC2 with:
git clone https://github.com/username/my-laravel-app.git
